# close they sit to that:
#
#   1. the binary's own hardening      is the shipped executable defended
#   2. gcc -fanalyzer                  leaks, double frees, null derefs
#   3. cppcheck + CERT C rules         the rule-based second opinion
#   4. clang's static analyzer         the third
#   5. flawfinder                      known-dangerous API use
#   6. semgrep                         pattern-based SAST
#   7. the sanitizers                  the real thing, at runtime
#   8. a short fuzz run                the real thing, on inputs nobody wrote
#   9. gitleaks                        committed secrets
#
# Anything not installed is reported as skipped rather than failing the run.

#   1.0.0.6        the tree is clean and HEAD is exactly the v1.0.0.6 tag
#   1.0.0.6-dev    v1.0.0.6 is the newest tag, but this tree is not it
#
# The base number comes from the VERSION file, which is the single source of
# truth: the Makefile compiles it in with -DTMD_VERSION and
# scripts/build-deb.sh writes debian/changelog from it.
#
# The "-dev" says the binary in front of you is not the released one. That
# matters most in a bug report: "1.0.0.6" is a version somebody else can
# download, and "1.0.0.6-dev" is a build only the person running it has, which
# is the difference between reproducing a problem and chasing it.
#
# A tree is "not the release" if any of these is true:
#   * a tracked file has been modified, staged or not
#   * HEAD is not the commit the matching tag points at (commits since the tag)
#   * there is no tag for this version at all (the usual case mid-development)
#
# Untracked files are deliberately NOT counted. A scratch archive, an editor's
# swap file or a downloaded test fixture does not change what was built, and
# treating them as a change would mean every working tree is permanently "-dev"
# for reasons that have nothing to do with the code.
#
# Outside a git checkout — a release tarball, a Debian source package, anything
# unpacked rather than cloned — there is nothing to compare against, so the base
# version is printed as-is. That is the right answer there: a source package is
# built from exactly what was released.

# build's number on a bug report as though anyone could download it.

# `make release` does not set it, so releases still prove themselves the usual

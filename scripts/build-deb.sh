# SERIES selects the Ubuntu release the package is built for. It defaults to

# one source package per series it targets, which is what the release workflow

# pinned in debian/control: DEBSIGN_KEYID is a global shell variable, and on a

# first. It is deliberately NOT consulted here.
#
# Only the SOURCE package is signed. That signature is what Launchpad
# authenticates the upload with. A binary .deb built locally is a test artifact
# that nothing verifies, so signing it only slows the build down and prompts
# for a passphrase nobody needed to type.

# `make install DESTDIR=...` both behave the way every other package expects.
#
# The default prefix is /usr/local, not /usr, and that is the important part.
# /usr belongs to the distribution's package manager: a file written there by
# hand is a file dpkg does not know about, and the next `apt install tmd` from
# the PPA would either overwrite it or fight it. /usr/local is the place the
# Filesystem Hierarchy Standard sets aside for exactly this -- software the
# administrator installed themselves -- and it is on PATH ahead of /usr/bin on
# every distribution worth the name.
